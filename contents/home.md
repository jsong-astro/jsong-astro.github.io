#### Research Experience
- The initiation of my astronomical pursuits commenced with the exploration of galaxy morphometry. I contributed to the development of an algorithm for efficiently quantifying nonparametric morphological parameters of galaxies, as well as an algorithm utilizing deep learning techniques for classifying galaxy morphology.
- Subsequently, I utilized JWST data to investigate the impact of rest-frame NIR data on stellar mass estimation through SED fitting, effectively resolving discrepancies between $M_{\ast, resolved}$ and $M_{\ast, unresolved}$ of galaxies. 
- Currently, my research focuses on analyzing slitless data from JWST, specifically examining the SFR and Metallicity Profiles at mid-high redshifts. Additionally, I am actively acquiring proficiency in processing IFU data and currently engaged in developing a data analysis pipeline tailored for CSST IFU data.
